## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Zero W with soldered pin headers.
- 4GB (or larger) microSD card
- Optional: case for the Pi Zero W
- Waveshare 2.13inch E-Ink display HAT (monochrome)

### Adapters
If you don't follow the instructions for [setting up a raspberry pi headless](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md), you will need to connect a keyboard and screen in order to enable ssh and enter your wifi details.  For this, you will need a USB OTG cable and mini-HDMI cable.  Some Pi Zero W kits come with these cables if you don't have them.

### Screens
Waveshare makes a few sizes of e-paper HAT displays.  The 2.13inch is the exact size of the Raspberry Pi Zero W.   The monochrome version has a very quick refresh rate.  Unfortunately, the 2-color versions take several seconds to redraw and I opted not to use those.  HAT devices plug directly into the pin header on the Pi, creating a nice, compact device.
